!!! note

    These operators are included and are intended to represent some of the most common Airflow Operators,
    but not _all_ Airflow Operators.

    Additional Operators can be created by subclassing [`OrbiterOperator`][orbiter.objects.task.OrbiterOperator]
    or using [`OrbiterTask`][orbiter.objects.task.OrbiterTask] directly.

    Review the [Astronomer Registry](https://registry.astronomer.io/) to find additional Airflow Operators.
