  <b>Astronomer Orbiter</b> can land legacy workloads safely down in a new home on Apache Airflow!
</p>

## What is Orbiter?
Orbiter is both a **CLI** and **Framework** for converting workflows
from other orchestration tools to Apache Airflow.

Generally it can be thoughts of as:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    origin{{ XML/JSON/YAML/Etc Workflows }}
    origin -->| âœ¨ Translations âœ¨ | airflow{{ Apache Airflow Project }}
```
The **framework** is a set of [Rules](./Rules_and_Rulesets) and [Objects](./objects) that can translate workflows
from an [Origin](./origins) system to an Airflow project.

## Installation

Install the [`orbiter` CLI](./CLI), if you have Python >= 3.10 installed via `pip`:
```shell
pip install astronomer-orbiter
```
If you do not have a compatible Python environment, pre-built binary executables of the `orbiter` CLI
are available for download on the [Releases](https://github.com/astronomer/orbiter/releases) page.

## Translate
Utilize the [`orbiter` CLI](./cli) with existing translations to convert workflows
from other systems to an Airflow project.

1. Set up a new folder, and create a `workflow/` folder. Add your workflows files to it
    ```shell
    .
    â””â”€â”€ workflow/
        â”œâ”€â”€ workflow_a.json
        â”œâ”€â”€ workflow_b.json
        â””â”€â”€ ...
    ```
2. Determine the specific translation ruleset via:
    1. the [Origins](origins) documentation
    2. the [`orbiter list-rulesets`](./cli#list-rulesets) command
    3. or [by creating a translation ruleset](#authoring-rulesets-customization), if one does not exist
3. Install the translation ruleset via the [`orbiter install`](./cli#install) command (substituting `<REPOSITORY>` with the value in the last step)
    ```shell
    orbiter install --repo=<REPOSITORY>
    ```
4. Use the [`orbiter translate`](./cli#translate) command with the `<RULESET>` determined in the last step
   This will produce output to an `output/` folder:
    ```shell
    orbiter translate workflow/ --ruleset <RULESET> output/
    ```
5. Review the contents of the `output/` folder. If extensions or customizations are required, review
    [how to extend a translation ruleset](#extend-or-customize)
6. (optional) Utilize the [`astro` CLI](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/overview)
    to run Airflow instance with your migrated workloads
7. (optional) Deploy to [Astro](https://www.astronomer.io/try-astro/) to run your translated workflows in production! ðŸš€

## Authoring Rulesets & Customization
Orbiter can be extended to fit specific needs, patterns, or to support additional origins.

Read more specifics about how to use the framework at [Rules](./Rules_and_Rulesets) and [Objects](./objects)

### Extend or Customize
To extend or customize an existing ruleset, you can easily modify it with simple Python code.

1. Set up your workspace as described in steps 1+2 of the [Translate](#translate) instructions
2. Create a Python script, named `override.py`
    ```shell
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ override.py
    â””â”€â”€ workflow/
        â”œâ”€â”€ workflow_a.json
        â”œâ”€â”€ workflow_b.json
        â””â”€â”€ ...
    ```
3. Add contents to `override.py`:
    ```python title="override.py" linenums="1"
    -8<- "tests/resources/override/override.py"
    ```
    1. Importing specific translation ruleset, determined via the [Origins](origins) page
    2. Importing required [Objects](./objects)
    3. Importing required [Rule](./Rules_and_Rulesets) types
    4. Create one or more `@rule` functions, as required. A higher priority means this rule will be applied first.
        [`@task_rule` Reference](./Rules_and_Rulesets/rules/#orbiter.rules.TaskRule)
    5. `Rules` have an `if/else` statement - they must always return a **single** thing or **nothing**
    6. [`OrbiterSSHOperator` Reference](./objects/Operators_and_Callbacks/operators/#orbiter.objects.operators.ssh.OrbiterSSHOperator)
    7. Append the new [Rule](./Rules_and_Rulesets)
       to the [`translation_ruleset`](./Rules_and_Rulesets/rulesets/#orbiter.rules.rulesets.TranslationRuleset)

4. Invoke the `orbiter` CLI, pointing it at your customized ruleset, and writing output to an `output/` folder:
    ```shell
    orbiter translate workflow/ output/ --ruleset override.translation_ruleset
    ```
5. Follow the remaining steps of the [Translate](#translate) instructions

### Authoring a new Ruleset

You can utilize the [`TranslationRuleset` Template](./Rules_and_Rulesets/template)
to create a new [`TranslationRuleset`][orbiter.rules.rulesets.TranslationRuleset].

## FAQ
- **Can this tool convert my workflows from tool X to Airflow?**

    _If you don't see your tool listed in [Supported Origins](./origins),
    [contact us](https://www.astronomer.io/contact/) for services to create translations,
    create an [issue](https://github.com/astronomer/orbiter-community-translations/issues/new/)
    in the [`orbiter-community-translations`](https://github.com/astronomer/orbiter-community-translations) repository, or write a `TranslationRuleset` and submit a
    [pull request](https://github.com/astronomer/orbiter-community-translations/pulls/)
    to share your translations with the community._

- **Are the results of this tool under any guarantee of correctness?**

    _**No.** This tool is provided as-is, with no guarantee of correctness.
    It is your responsibility to verify the results.
    We accept Pull Requests to improve parsing,
    and strive to make the tool easily configurable to handle your specific use-case._
